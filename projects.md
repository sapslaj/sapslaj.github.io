Sometimes I work on stuff! My major projects are hosted on the [The Layer 8 website](http://layer8.network/), and the rest is pretty much contained to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sapslaj). But if I'm working on anything remotely noteworthy I'll post it here, I guess.

--------

### [youtube-dl.rb](https://github.com/layer8x/youtube-dl.rb)

It's a Ruby wrapper for youtube-dl. That's pretty much it. It's branded under Layer 8, but whatev.

--------

### [out](https://github.com/sapslaj/out)

This is a project to output everything, like interchanging `ls` and `cat`. The current version is written in Ruby and very PoC, and will probably be written in something more portable like Go whenever I feel like not being lazy.

--------

### [webdev-with-rack](https://github.com/sapslaj/webdev-with-rack)

Boilerplate to get started developing a web application with Rack and Guard. Initializr wasn't enough. Rails, Sinatra, Padrino, etc is too much. Yeoman is just over-engineered. So I built on top of [asdf](https://github.com/ddfreyne/adsf) and made this.

--------

### [git-import](https://github.com/sapslaj/git-import)

Well, webdev-with-rack was nice, but doing `git clone` all the time was stupid. So I made this! It's pretty much totally useless because it just does `git clone --depth=1 --branch=master`.

--------

### [jekyll-book](https://github.com/sapslaj/jekyll-book)

A shitty template for making books with Jekyll. It's so shitty I didn't even make a README for it. But hey, you can use `git-import` for this!

--------

### [Ferri](https://github.com/sapslaj/Ferri)

I made a game engine! Well, I really haven't yet. Right now it's just an extention for [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/). It's also written in CoffeeScript! So that's cool, I guess. [Oh wait, CoffeeScript is dead or dying.](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3qt1i9/is_es6_better_than_coffeescript/cwicq20)

--------

### [Rope](https://github.com/sapslaj/rope)

It's a Vine parody/reimplementation/whatever you want to call it that I attempted to make in a weekend. It really sucks and it's probably broken.

--------

### [Cube Benchmark](http://sapslaj.github.io/cube-benchmark/)

Benchmark WebGL performance.
