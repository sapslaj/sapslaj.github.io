Welp, I did what all of the new kids are doing and switched to Jekyll for my "professional" blog. Still calling it a blag, because edginess. Oh by the way, how do you like the style? I made it myself. :O

And yes, I can do syntax highlighting...

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
